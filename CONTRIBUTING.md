# How to contribute

We welcome contributions as we embark on this project and we thank you for visiting this page. To make feedback and changes as seamless as possible, we've laid out some ways to make the most out of contributions for everyone:

## Forking the repository

We reccomend forking the repository so you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

You can do this by following these steps...

1. Log into your GitHub account and find the repository.
2. Click 'Fork' (last button on the top right of the repository page).
3. You will then have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## Submitting changes

Once you're happy with your changes, please send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/AnselmPowell/single-portal-prototype/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

It can also be helpful to write a prefix in your brief summary of your commit to signal what type of work you have completed, e.g., 'docs', 'fix', 'feature', 'style' etc.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log into your GitHub account and find the repository.
2. Click on the 'Code' button (next to 'Add file').
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under clone with HTTPS, copy the link.
4. Then open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. In your IDE's terminal type 'git clone' followed by the URL you copied.
7. Press Enter.
8. Your local clone will now be made.
